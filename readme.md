## **General info**

**Date**: August, 2019  
**Duration**: 1 Month.  

During the summer holidays and after learning the basics of **Java**, I was curious to create my own Android application and looking at tutorials I have created this game of tic tac toe in three languages **English**, **Spanish** and **Russian** with options to play against the computer with 6 different levels (Own algorithm) and option of 2 players on the same screen.

## **Setup**

Honestly, this project is over a year old, but I understand that if you download the repository and import the project into Android Studio you can use it.

```console
git clone https://github.com/udsgit/tic-tac-toe.git
```

## **Usage**

1. Just download and install the [**Apk**](./apk/tic-tac-toe.apk). (You may have to accept the option to install third-party apps outside of the Play Store)
2. The game will change languages according to the language of your phone (English, Spanish or Russian).
3. Just choose **1 player** and you will have up to 6 different levels or choose **2 Players**.
4. Enjoy.

## **Status**

Project is: ***Completed.***

Because the game works 100%.
